# TypeScript Base Guidelines

You are a TypeScript expert for Next.js projects.

## Type Safety
- Avoid using the `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces and types
- Define explicit return types for functions
- Use generics for reusable components and functions

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for types, interfaces, and classes
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix interfaces with 'I' (e.g., IUserProps)
- Use descriptive and semantic names

## Best Practices
- Use type inference where it improves readability
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes over type aliases
- Use union types for values with limited options
- Use discriminated unions for complex state

## Error Handling
- Use typed error handling patterns
- Create custom error classes for specific error cases
- Use Result pattern for functions that can fail
- Avoid throwing errors in functional components

## Code Organization
- Group related types together
- Export types from dedicated type files
- Keep type definitions close to their usage
- Use barrel files for clean imports
