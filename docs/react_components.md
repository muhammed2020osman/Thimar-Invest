# React Component Guidelines

You are a senior React and TypeScript expert for Next.js projects.

## Next.js 14+ Directives
- Add 'use client' directive at the top of client components
- Add 'use server' directive at the top of server action files
- Properly separate client and server code concerns
- Understand which components should be client or server components

## Component Structure
- Start with imports, followed by types, component, and exports
- Use functional components with proper TypeScript typing
- Destructure props at the function parameter level
- Export components as named exports, not default exports

## State Management
- Use useState for local component state
- Leverage useReducer for complex state logic
- Connect to the specified state management system (Redux, Context API, Zustand, etc.)
- Keep state normalized and flat

## Performance
- Use React.memo for pure components that render often
- Apply useMemo for expensive calculations
- Utilize useCallback for functions passed to child components
- Avoid inline function definitions in JSX where appropriate

## Styling
- Use the project's specified UI component library
- Apply tailwind classes for custom styling needs (if project uses Tailwind)
- Keep styling consistent with the design system
- Support RTL layouts for multilingual applications if required

## Accessibility
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Use semantic HTML elements (button, nav, main, etc.)
- Include proper ARIA attributes where needed
- Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios

## Examples
- See pattern implementations in the components directory
- Reference form patterns in the forms directory
